## Growtopia Statistics (Growstats)

Comprehensive down detector and server uptime monitoring page for the Growtopia Game.
Uses `Cron` to automate the collection of online player count from the Growtopia API endpoint (every minute).
Then saves the data to a `csv` file, to be read line by line for statistical visualization with `Chart.js`.
Currently experimenting and looking for better algorithms involving Machine learning to be able to give a prediction on the `Server Confidence`.
